Brett Sartain Custom Wordpress Theme
======
This is a child theme I created for various uses. I'm using the HTML5 template http://themehybrid.com/themes/kepler as a base and everything else is custom WordPress api's.

It was primarily used for churches and religious organizations.

To use, download and place inside of your themes directory in your WordPress install. Make sure to activate the theme once it's installed. 

v1.0.1
